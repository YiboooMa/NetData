### Abstract
We gathered a dataset of measurement reports, including traffic volume, energy consumption, and base station attributes for city-scale mobile networks. It includes data from over 10,000 4G base stations and 5,000 5G base stations, capturing the complexity of real-world network operations. To support the research community, we have published a portion of the dataset, including complete record traces of all base stations over one weekday and one weekend.

Items of the published data are as follows.

| Items collected | Description |
|:-------|:-------|
| Base station ID | An unique identification for the base station |
| Cell ID | An unique identification for the cell |
| Timestamp | The time the record was gathered |
| PRB usage ratio | The percentage of the cell's total available physical resource blocks (PRB) that are currently being utilized, measured in % |
| Traffic volume | Average volume of traffic, measured in KBytes |
| \# of users | Average number of users served |
| BBU energy | Energy consumption of the base station's baseband unit (BBU), measured in Kilo Watt Hours |
| RRU energy | Energy consumption of the cell's remote radio unit (RRU), measured in Kilo Watt Hours |
| Channel Shutdown time | Average time of the cell is in channel shutdown control, measured in Millisecond |
| Carrier Shutdown time | Average time of the cell is in carrier shutdown control, measured in Millisecond |
| Deep sleep time | Average time of the cell is in deep sleep mode, measured in Millisecond |
